# QKD_TFM
Hardware description for the control of a transmitter for a QKD system prototype.

The source code, the testbenches and the constraints (.xdc file) are on the .src folder, in the subdirectories sources_1, sim_1 and constrs_1 respectively.

The .wcfg files are the waveforms for the presentation of the signals while simulating on Xilinx Vivado.

The code has been implemented and tested over a Basys3 development board.
The basys3.vhd is the implementation of the top.vhd to adapt it to the inputs and outputs of the board.
